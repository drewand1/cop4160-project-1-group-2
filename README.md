# Shell

This is a very rudimentary shell. It does everything it's supposed to do, plus
the extra credit.

It has colors :)

## How to Compile & Execute

### Requirements
- **Compiler**: gcc

### Compilation
To build, run the following:
```bash
make
```
This will make the executable in [project folder]/bin/shell. You can directly
execute this executable with ./bin/shell

| 2025-09-26 | Made pipes. |
| 2025-09-28 | Made background processing. Made exit wait for background processes. Made jobs internal command. Also fixed up some readme stuff. |

## Meetings
Document in-person meetings, their purpose, and what was discussed.

We had no in-person meetings for this project. Everything occurred over email
and text.


## Bugs
- **Errors In Pipes**: Unexpected behavior may occur when a command in a pipe chain errors.
- **2 commands**: If only 2 commands were run in the shell process's lifespan, the command log displayed when exit is run will only show the second.

## Extra Credit
- **Extra Credit 1**: Unlimited pipes - this shell supports an unlimited number of pipes in one command.
- **Extra Credit 2**: Shell-ception - you can execute this shell using this shell as many times as you want.
- **Extra Credit 3**: Piping and I/O redirection - you can redirect input on the first command and redirect output on the last command in a pipe chain. This shell does not, however, support I/O redirection on commands that are not either the first or last in the pipe chain.

**We have completed all 3 extra credit tasks.**

## Considerations
Note that when combining IO redirection and pipes, you may only redirect input
to the first command in the pipe chain, and you may only redirect output from
the last command in the pipe chain.

This project was finished at 9/28/2025 at 9:17 PM, a little over 24 hours before
the due date. We sincerely apologize if there are any bugs we didn't catch. But
bugs make for more fun, don't they?
